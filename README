Django QR
=========

Information
===========

Django QR is a simple Django application that provides some templatetags
that allows to include automatically QR codes on the Django site.

Installation
============

Once is installed from PyPI, you just need to add it to your settings as
'qrcode':

::

  INSTALLED_APPS = (..., 'qrcode', ...)

Usage
=====

Its usage is very simple. You just need to use the templatetag as follows:

::

  {% load qr_tags %}

  ...

  {% qr_from_text "text" "size" %}
  or
  {% qr_from_mail "mail_address" "size" %}


Where:

 * Size is not mandatory, and defines the dimensions of the QR code as following: 's' (120x120 pixels), 'm' (230x230 pixels), 'l' (350x350) or an integer with the size that you want to give to the QR-code (like 40, 80 or 500). Any other option will be ignored and will use 'm' as default.
 * qr_from_mail tag just add a simple "mailto:" at the beggining, because some qr scanners can detect that as an email address in order to send it an email.

QR-code for contact information
-------------------------------

There's also a templatetag to render a QR-code that allows to store
some contact information, such as name, phone number, email address or
our company name.

Its usage is similiar to the basics:

::

   {% qr_from contact contact "size" %}

Where:

 * Size is the same as previosly
 * contact should be a Python dictionary (or any other hash structure) that could contain the following elements:

  * *name* - Complete name
  * *phone_number*
  * *email*
  * *url* - some url address, your blog or personal webpage
  * *company*

For instance, you could create a contact dictionary like the following:

::

    contact = {
        'name': 'Pablo Recio',
        'phone_number': '00000000',
        'email': 'foo@example.com',
        'url': 'http://www.zocolab.es',
        'company': 'Zocolab',
    }


QR-code of Django object URL
----------------------------

Another templatetag can be used to render a QR-code that links to a Django object URL. As
the previous templatetags, the usage is very simple:

::
   {% qr_from_object object "size" %}

Where:

 * Size is the same as previosly
 * Object it's an instance of a Django model, that must implements the 'get_absolute_url' method in order to get the object's address.

Change service for QR generating
--------------------------------

By default, django-qr uses Google Chart for generating the QR-code. But this can be changed with a new template. The default
template *qrcode/qr_tag.html* contains the following:

::

<img src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=qr&chs={{ size }}x{{ size }}&chl={{ text }}" />

But if you want to use some other service, like *qrserver*, you just need to add a new template in your templates dirs with
the following code:

::

<img src="http://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?size={{ size }}x{{ size }}&data={{ text }}" />

The idea is that your *qrcode/qr_tag.html* contains an img tag and the call to the service that you want, mantaining the
variables *size* and *data*.
